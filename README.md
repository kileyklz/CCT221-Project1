# CCT221-Project1
# 1. Implement Classes:
#    - Refactor existing code into classes (e.g., Paddle, Ball, PowerUp, Bomb, Barrier, Score).
#    - Define attributes and methods for each class.

# 2. Ball Physics: Amanda
#    - Implement basic ball physics:
#      - Movement, velocity, acceleration.
#      - Collision detection with walls, paddles, power-ups, bombs, and barriers.

# 3. Smoothing out Paddle Movement: Kiley
#    - Add logic to smooth out paddle movement, ensuring it doesn't jerk abruptly.
#    - Adjust paddle movement speed or acceleration to achieve smoother motion.

# 4. Sprites for Balls: Amanda
#    - Integrate sprite images for the balls.
#    - Replace basic shape with loaded sprite image for visual enhancement.

# 5. Barrier for Walls: DONE
#    - Implement barriers at top and bottom walls.
#    - Prevent ball from going off-screen.
#    - Modify collision detection logic to handle barriers.

# 6. Implementing Power Up (Increase/Decrease Size of Paddle): Amanda
#    - Create PowerUp class inheriting from Turtle.
#    - Add methods to increase/decrease paddle size upon collision with power-up.
#    - Modify collision detection logic to trigger size changes.

# 7. Implementing Bomb (Decreases Score): Amanda
#    - Create Bomb class inheriting from Turtle.
#    - Add methods to decrease score upon collision with bomb.
#    - Update score display logic to reflect changes caused by collisions.

# 8. Over Time Ball Movement Speed Increase: Kiley
#    - Define variable to track ball's movement speed.
#    - Gradually increase ball's speed over time within game loop.

# 9. Changing Score: Kiley
#    - Create Score class to manage game's score.
#    - Add methods to update score based on game events.
#    - Update score display logic to reflect changes in score.
